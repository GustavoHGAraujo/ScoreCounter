### Development

To start working on the app yourself, you have to follow these steps

1. Clone the repository (or a fork of it). Follow the instructions [here](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/)
2. The app uses Google Firebase, to be able to build it you need to:
   1. Create a Project on https://console.firebase.google.com/ 
   2. Download the `google-services.json`
   3. Place it in the projects `app` directory as shown on the firebase page
3. If you get an error related to signingConfigs go to your `app\build.gradle` and remove all settings related to `signingConfigs` since you do need to build signed releses of the app (alternatively create appropriate configs).
4. Open the project in Android Studio an start working
5. Send me a "pull request" from your repo - see instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)

### Helping Translate

If you want to help translate the App you can do this in multiple ways.

With Android Studio open any of the `string.xml` files in the `res\values` directory and add a new locale using the translation editor. Without Android Studio just create a `values` folder with the desired country code and translate in the xml file itself.

**Don't forget** to add your locale code to the `resConfig` setting in `app\build.gradle` (otherwise it wont be applied).

If you've never used git and not familiar with Android development, download [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/n-apps/ScoreCounter/master/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml) and edit it using the text editor of your choice (notepad etc...) and just email your modified files to me.
